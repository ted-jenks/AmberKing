        The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of carbon emmissions globally. However, finding responsible,
        sustainable
        fashion brands that can compete with the prices offered by the fast-fashion industry remains impossible. Ginger
        and Peach aims to remedy this issue. It is a sustainable clothing brand started out of my bedroom that aims to
        offer young people an accessible option for sustainable fashion. This is achieved by using dead-stock materials
        and clever manufacturing methods.

      With a marketing budget of £0, I was able to build a sizeable following online by taking advantage of social media
      platforms such as TikTok. Just 2 months after starting the brand, I had gained over 10,000 followers on TikTok
      alone by making trend based content and documenting my journey from a very human perspective.
