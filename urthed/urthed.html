      <h1>Branding</h1>
      </br>
      I was hired by a small, start-up cosmetic and fashion store to do a complete rebrand. This involved developing an
      entirely new image based around an entirely new name. Urthed foccusses on being entirely vegan and entirely
      sustainable. All items are accreditted to be cruelty free to a very high level of scrutiny.

        <h1>Logo</h1>
        The design of the new logo was focussed around having a long-form and short-form version that linked together
        well. This is vital for internet based businesses where in many cases, a small icon will be all that is visable.
        The 'U' here has been used to evoke images of nature, and this same shape is rotated to be incorporated into the
        short-form logo which is more explicitly a plant sprouting from the ground.

        <h1>Instagram GIFS</h1>
        As a brand aimed at young, socially concious people, social media imagery and awareness is critical for Urthed's
        success. As a part of the rebrand, I decided to target this by producing GIFs to function as Instagram stickers
        for customers and supporters to use in stories. These help create outreach in a fun and easy way.
