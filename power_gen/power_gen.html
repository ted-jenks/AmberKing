        If we hope to beat the climate crisis faced by humanity, we must form clear achievable plans for the path we
        must take
        forward. In this project, I took Wales as a case study and proposed a plan for a realistic grid composition to
        aim for in
        10 years.
        The aim of this case study was to reach 0% reliance on fossil fuels without sacrificing reliability,
        stability, or cost
        effectiveness. The following info-graphics outline the findings and conclusions of the study.

          Wales is already on a fantastic trajectory with its energy generation. Since 2006, their yearly energy
          consumption has come down 15% while many other nations have seen great increases. They have also recognised
          the
          fantatic natural resources available to them, and are now producing 50% of their energy from renewable
          sources.

          Currently, much of the renewable energy being used is produced by wind farms, which is unsuprising given the
          Welsh climate and proximity to the sea. The fossil fuels still in use are primary natural gases. These are not
          as bad as some of the other options, such as coal, but are still contributing to the worrying rate of climate
          change we are currently undergoing.

          To build on the successful foundations already built, the proposal suggests an aggresive plan to completely
          eradicate all reliance on fossil fuels over a 10 year period. The renewable portion of the energy production
          has been designed around using well developed, low cost methods such as wind and solar power, as well as more
          experimental options which could help give a consistant base supply, such as bio-mass and tidal power.

          The rest of the power will come from modern, safe nuclear power plants. These are heavily adopted in countries
          such as France and have been shown to be far safer than other fuel options, in spite of the bad reputation.
          The cost of this would be high, but extreme actions are required to eliminate the use of fossil fuels.

          Just two high capacity nuclear plants would be able to generate 30% of the power needed by Wales. With the
          other 70% coming from renewables, we have a realistic, achievable way of reaching a sustainable energy
          production plan.
